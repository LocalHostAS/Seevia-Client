Seevia client
=============

Client implementing Seevia API for performing various operations in Seevia (http://www.seevia.me). Requires a valid partner token to work as intended. To obtain a valid token, contact Seevia (mailto:post@seevia.no).

A client interface has been defined in order to ease the process of mocking / stubbing the client if used while performing unit tests.

Test runner
------------
Insert partner token in app.config before running tests.
